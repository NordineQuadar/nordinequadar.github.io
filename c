[31m-[m
[31m-Here we will give you some tips on how to customize the website. One important thing to note is that **ALL** the changes you make should be done on the **main** branch of your repository. The `gh-pages` branch is automatically overwritten every time you make a change to the main branch.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Note that throughout the [README.md](README.md) and [CUSTOMIZE.md](CUSTOMIZE.md) files, the default language is English (LANG = en-us). You must have an equivalent file or path for each language you have defined in [\_config.yml](_config.yml). For example, if you have defined `languages: ["en-us", "pt-br"]`, you must have 2 versions of the file `_data/LANG/cv.yml`: [\_data/en-us/cv.yml](_data/en-us/cv.yml) and [\_data/pt-br/cv.yml](_data/pt-br/cv.yml).[m

[31m-## Displaying countries flags[m
[31m-[m
[31m-To display countries flags instead of the language initials in the header, you can set `country_flag: true` in the [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file. You should also add the countries' svg flags in the [assets/img/flags/](assets/img/flags/) directory. You can find the flags in the [flag-icons repository](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons/tree/main/flags). When selecting the flags, the code uses the last part (after the `-`) of the site languages. So when looking for the flag of the language `pt-br`, the code will look for the file `br.svg` in the [assets/img/flags/](assets/img/flags/) directory.[m

[31m-## Modifying the CV information[m
[31m-[m
[31m-There are currently 2 different ways of generating the CV page content. The first one is by using a json file located in [assets/json/resume_LANG.json](assets/json/resume_en-us.json). It is a [known standard](https://jsonresume.org/) for creating a CV programmatically. The second one, currently used as a fallback when the json file is not found, is by using a yml file located in [\_data/LANG/cv.yml](_data/en-us/cv.yml). This was the original way of creating the CV page content and since it is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-What this means is, if there is no resume data defined in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) and loaded via a json file, it will load the contents of [\_data/LANG/cv.yml](_data/en-us/cv.yml). If you want to use the [\_data/LANG/cv.yml](_data/en-us/cv.yml) file as the source of your CV, you must delete the [assets/json/resume_LANG.json](assets/json/resume_en-us.json) file.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Modifying the user and repository information[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The user and repository information is defined in [\_data/repositories.yml](_data/repositories.yml). You can add as many users and repositories as you want. Both informations are used in the `repositories` section.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Creating new pages[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can create new pages by adding new Markdown files in the [\_pages](_pages/) directory. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing page and modify it. You can choose the layout of the page by changing the [layout](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/) attribute in the [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) of the Markdown file, and also the path to access it by changing the [permalink](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) attribute. You can also add new layouts in the [\_layouts](_layouts/) directory if you feel the need for it. To have the page be displayed for different languages, simply create one markdown file with the same name in each language. It is possible to [use different permalinks per language](https://github.com/untra/polyglot?tab=readme-ov-file#using-different-permalinks-per-language) if you want to.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Creating new blog posts[m
[31m-[m
[31m-To create a new blog post, you can add a new Markdown file in the [\_posts/LANG/](_posts/en-us/) directory. The [name of the file must follow](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-posts) the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing blog post and modify it. Note that some blog posts have optional fields in the [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) that are used to enable specific behaviors or functions.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If you want to create blog posts that are not ready to be published, but you want to track it with git, you can create a [\_drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts) directory and store them there.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Creating new projects[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can create new projects by adding new Markdown files in the [\_projects/LANG/](_projects/en-us/) directory. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing project and modify it.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Adding some news[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can add news in the about page by adding new Markdown files in the [\_news/LANG/](_news/en-us/) directory. There are currently two types of news: inline news and news with a link. News with a link take you to a new page while inline news are displayed directly in the about page. The easiest way to create yours is to copy an existing news and modify it.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Adding Collections[m
[31m-[m
[31m-This Jekyll theme implements `collections` to let you break up your work into categories. The theme comes with two default collections: `news` and `projects`. Items from the `news` collection are automatically displayed on the home page. Items from the `projects` collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is. To do this, edit the collections in the [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to [\_pages/LANG/projects.md](_pages/en-us/projects.md).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Adding a new publication[m
[31m-[m
[31m-To add publications create a new entry in the [\_bibliography/papers.bib](_bibliography/papers.bib) file. You can find the BibTeX entry of a publication in Google Scholar by clicking on the quotation marks below the publication title, then clicking on "BibTeX", or also in the conference page itself. By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the `Jekyll Scholar` section in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the `assets/pdfs/` directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the `pdf` field. Some of the supported fields are: `abstract`, `altmetric`, `arxiv`, `bibtex_show`, `blog`, `code`, `dimensions`, `doi`, `eprint`, `html`, `isbn`, `pdf`, `pmid`, `poster`, `slides`, `supp`, `video`, and `website`.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### Author annotation[m
[31m-[m
[31m-In publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string array `scholar:last_name` and string array `scholar:first_name` in [\_config.yml](_config.yml). For example, if you have the following entry in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml):[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```yaml[m
[31m-scholar:[m
[31m-  last_name: [Einstein][m
[31m-  first_name: [Albert, A.][m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If the entry matches one form of the last names and the first names, it will be underlined. Keep meta-information about your co-authors in [\_data/coauthors.yml](_data/coauthors.yml) and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically. The co-author data format is as follows,[m

Set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` or to `https://<your.custom.domain>` if you are using a custom domain. If you are deploying a personal or organization website, leave `baseurl` blank. If you are deploying a project page, set `baseurl: /<your-project-name>/`. If all previous steps were done correctly, all is missing is [for your browser to fetch again the site stylesheet](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/1398#issuecomment-1609518404).[m

[31m-#### My site doesn't work when I enable `related_blog_posts`. Why?[m
[31m-[m
[31m-This is probably due to the [classifier reborn](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn) plugin, which is used to calculate related posts. If the error states `Liquid Exception: Zero vectors can not be normalized...` or `sqrt': Numerical argument is out of domain - "sqrt"`, it means that it could not calculate related posts for a specific post. This is usually caused by [empty or minimal blog posts](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn/issues/64) without meaningful words (i.e. only [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words)) or even [specific characters](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn/issues/194) you used in your posts. Also, the calculus for similar posts are made for every `post`, which means every page that uses `layout: post`, including the announcements. To change this behavior, simply add `related_posts: false` to the front matter of the page you don't want to display related posts on. Another solution is to disable the lsi (latent semantic indexing) entirely by removing the `--lsi` flag in the code. Related issue: [#1828](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/1828).[m

[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If that's the case, you are using deprecated libraries/commands. This happens because you are using a very old version of al-folio. To fix this it is recommended [upgrading your code to the latest version](INSTALL.md#upgrading-from-a-previous-version) of the template. You will probably need to do some manual merging. If you find it easier, you could create a copy of your repository, do a fresh installation from the template and reapply all your changes. For this I would recommend a tool like [meld](https://meldmerge.org/) or [winmerge](https://winmerge.org/) to check the differences between directories/files.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Note that libraries tend to be deprecated and support for them dropped as they are no longer maintained, and keep using them involves security breaches. Also, some of these deprecations are enforced, for example, by GitHub itself, so there's so much we can do. We have also added tons of new functionality, as well as tidying things up and improving the overall speed and structure, so you could also benefit from these improvements.[m

[31m-GitHub actions are a way to automate tasks in the repository. They are defined in `.github/workflows/` directory. Each file in this directory is a workflow. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs, and each job runs on a virtual machine hosted by GitHub. You can see the status of the workflows in the `Actions` tab of your repository.

[31m-## Recommended Approach[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The recommended approach for using **al-folio** is to first create your own site using the template with as few changes as possible, and only when it is up and running customize it however you like. This way it is easier to pinpoint what causes a potential issue in case of a bug. The minimum steps required to create your own site are:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-1. Create a new repository using this template. For this, click on [Use this template -> Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=multi-language-al-folio&template_owner=george-gca) above the file list. If you plan to upload your site to `<your-github-username>.github.io`, note that the name of your repository :warning: **MUST BE** :warning: `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`, as stated in the [GitHub pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).[m
[31m-2. In this new repository, go to `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions` and give `Read and write permissions` to GitHub Actions.[m
[31m-3. Open file `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` **empty** (do NOT delete it).[m
[31m-4. Wait until the GitHub actions finish (check your repository **Actions** tab). Now, in addition to the master branch, your repository has a newly built gh-pages branch.[m
[31m-5. Finally, in the repository page go to `Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment`, make sure that `Source` is set to `Deploy from a branch` and set the branch to `gh-pages` (NOT to master).[m
[31m-6. Wait until the GitHub actions finish (check your repository **Actions** tab), then simply navigate to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` in your browser. At this point you should see a copy of the theme's [demo website](https://george-gca.github.io/multi-language-al-folio/).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-After everything is set up, you can download the repository to your machine and start customizing it. To do so, run the following commands:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```bash[m
[31m-$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Starting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Local setup on Windows[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If you are using Windows, it is **highly recommended** to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which is a compatibility layer for running Linux on top of Windows. You can follow [these instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support) to install WSL and Ubuntu on your machine. You only need to go up to the step 4 of the tutorial (you don't have to enable the optional `systemd` nor the graphical applications), and then you can follow the instructions below to install docker. You can install docker natively on Windows as well, but it has been having some issues as can be seen in [#1540](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/1540), [#2007](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/2007).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Local setup using Docker (Recommended)[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Using Docker to install Jekyll and Ruby dependencies is the easiest way.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running on your local machine:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-- First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).[m
[31m-- Finally, run the following command that will pull the latest pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```bash[m
[31m-$ docker compose pull[m
[31m-$ docker compose up[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m

[31m-### Multi Language Support[m
[31m-[m
[31m-In a previous version this was achieved using the [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin), but since the plugin repository has been archived it was replaced by the [polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot) plugin. This plugin was created based on the functionalities of the [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin) and it is actively maintained. For more information about this change, see [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The default language (and used as a fallback language when a link for a different language is not found) will be the language defined as `default_lang` in the [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file. When using two languages, the theme will show a button in the header that switches to the other language directly.[m

[31m-Note that throughout the [README.md](README.md) and [CUSTOMIZE.md](CUSTOMIZE.md) files, the default language is English (LANG = en-us). You must have an equivalent file or path for each language you have defined in [\_config.yml](_config.yml). For example, if you have defined `languages: ["en-us", "pt-br"]`, you must have 2 versions of the file `_data/LANG/cv.yml`: [\_data/en-us/cv.yml](_data/en-us/cv.yml) and [\_data/pt-br/cv.yml](_data/pt-br/cv.yml).[m

[31m-### CV[m
[31m-[m
[31m-There are currently 2 different ways of generating the CV page content. The first one is by using a json file located in [assets/json/resume_LANG.json](assets/json/resume_en-us.json). It is a [known standard](https://jsonresume.org/) for creating a CV programmatically. The second one, currently used as a fallback when the json file is not found, is by using a yml file located in [\_data/LANG/cv.yml](_data/en-us/cv.yml). This was the original way of creating the CV page content and since it is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-What this means is, if there is no resume data defined in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) and loaded via a json file, it will load the contents of [\_data/LANG/cv.yml](_data/en-us/cv.yml) as fallback.[m

You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing [\_pages/publications.md](_pages/publications.md). By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the `Jekyll Scholar` section in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the [assets/pdf/](assets/pdf/) directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the `pdf` field. Some of the supported fields are: `abstract`, `altmetric`, `arxiv`, `bibtex_show`, `blog`, `code`, `dimensions`, `doi`, `eprint`, `html`, `isbn`, `pdf`, `pmid`, `poster`, `slides`, `supp`, `video`, and `website`.[m

[31m-**al-folio** supports preview images on social media. To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml). Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews. This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable. If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml). In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews.[m

[31m-# Upgrading[m
[31m-[m
[31m-As of Jan 15, 2024, the [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin) repository has been archived by its owner and is now read-only, meaning it will not receive further updates. As discussed in [#17](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/issues/17), one possible solution was to replace the plugin with [jekyll-polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot). This change has been implemented as of version 1.11.0 of this theme.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Project changes[m
[31m-[m
[31m-A few changes were made necessary by the switch to `polyglot`. More specifically:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-- all usages of `site.lang` were replaced by `site.active_lang`, since this is how the `polyglot` plugin stores the active language[m
[31m-- moved `_i18n/` contents to their respective `LANG/` directories inside the `_news/`, `_pages/`, `_posts/`, and `_projects/` directories. E.g.: `_i18n/en-us/_pages/about.md` was moved to `_pages/en-us/about.md`[m
[31m-- a few modifications were made to the `_config.yml` file related to the `polyglot` plugin[m
[31m-- contents of the files `_i18n/LANG.yml` were moved to `_data/LANG/strings.yml`. Note that not all variables were moved. The rest of the variables were used directly in the pages contents[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### Directory changes[m
[31m-[m
[31m-[Previously](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/tree/8f1528a4816aaf16e916791ae0f8cddbecf2416a) some pages were composed by a main page, like the [\_pages/about.md](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/blob/8f1528a4816aaf16e916791ae0f8cddbecf2416a/_pages/about.md) page, and a translated subpage, like the [\_i18n/en-us/\_pages/about.md](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/blob/8f1528a4816aaf16e916791ae0f8cddbecf2416a/_i18n/en-us/_pages/about.md). This structure was changed to a single page with all the content in the same file, one file for each language in [\_pages/LANG/](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/tree/main/_pages/en-us). This change was made to simplify the structure of the theme and to make it easier to maintain. It also allows to have completely different pages for different languages if needed.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### Translated strings[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Another change was the usage of translated strings in the pages. Before, the translated strings were used in the pages by using the `t` filter, like `{% t titles.about %}`, and these strings were defined inside [\_i18n/LANG.yml](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/blob/8f1528a4816aaf16e916791ae0f8cddbecf2416a/_i18n/en-us.yml). Now, when possible, the translated strings are used directly in the pages for that language. When a string is used at the layout level, like in the [\_layouts/about.liquid](_layouts/about.liquid) file, we now have to call for the translated string inside [\_data/LANG/strings.yml](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/blob/main/_data/en-us/strings.yml). What previously was:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```liquid[m
[31m-{% t main.contact_note %}[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m

[31m-```liquid[m
[31m-{{ site.data[site.active_lang].strings.contact_note }}[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### Other information[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Due to the usage of the `polyglot` plugin, a lot of the previous workarounds were made unnecessary. For example, the `t` filter was used to translate the `page.title` and `page.description` variables in a lot of different files. Now, the values of these variables can be directly used. The same applies to some solutions regarding page redirects or assets usage. For example, in the file [\_layouts/archive-category.liquid](_layouts/archive-category.liquid), we had this piece of code:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```liquid[m
[31m-{% assign is_asset = post.redirect | startswith: '/assets/' %}[m
[31m-{% if is_asset %}[m
[31m-  <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.redirect | prepend: site.baseurl_root }}">{{ post.title }}</a>[m
[31m-{% else %}[m
[31m-  <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.redirect | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>[m
[31m-{% endif %}[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Which was responsible to assess if the `post.redirect` was an asset or a page and to build the correct link considering the current language. Now, we can simply use:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```liquid[m
[31m-<a class="post-link" href="{{ post.redirect | relative_url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-since the `polyglot` plugin takes care of the language prefix in the URLs.[m

[31m-  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},[m

[31m-Let's break it down: this is possible thanks to [Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin](https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook) that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls [`jupyter nbconvert --to html`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html) to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since [Kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/) is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the [::nomarkdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions) tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the `file_exists` filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user. The code displayed above outputs the following:[m

[31m-Let's break it down: this is possible thanks to [Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin](https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook) that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls [`jupyter nbconvert --to html`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html) to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since [Kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/) is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the [::nomarkdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions) tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the `file_exists` filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user. The code displayed above outputs the following:[m
