abstract="The purpose of this paper is to discuss different existing technologies related to sensing in smart cities. The continuous growth of urban areas is a reality that should be faced by innovating more solutions that are efficient. Smart cities are one of the remarkable solutions, it can be seen as different intelligent systems or platforms that work together to ensure better sustainability. Sensors are at the core of smart cities. They collect data from different environments or infrastructures in order to send them to the cloud using different communications platforms. These data can be used to better manage the infrastructures or provide smarter services. However, they are various issues and challenges related to the ubiquitous sensors that should be solved. In the last section of this paper, a case study of smart water distribution system is presented with an overview of the related issues and challenges such as reliability, cost, and scalability. Also, a table is provided in this section to compare the results and challenges of the last five studies on producing smart pipes with the most common challenges.",
