We discussed how AI can play a major role in both sides of the game, either as defender and attacker. In this release, we are slightly shifting our focus to another critical aspect and hot topic of IoT security: Secure-by-Design (SbD). Could this be the key to truly secure IoT devices from the ground up?</p> <h2 id="introduction" style="--stagger: 4;" data-animate="">Introduction</h2> <p style="--stagger: 5;" data-animate="">As our world becomes increasingly connected, with more than 16 billion devices already in use and integrated into our daily lives and industries and a total of 40 billion to be connected by 2030, the need for robust security has never been more pressing. From personal data and intellectual property to national security, the risks introduced by vulnerable IoT devices are significant and growing very fast. In this article, I want to dive into this concept that might just be the answer to many of these challenges.</p> <p style="--stagger: 6;" data-animate="">The first question one may ask is what Secure-by-design is! Actually, this is not a novel concept. Its roots trace back to the early days of computer security around 1970. However, its application to IoT is making it a hot topic these days. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) defines it as “technology products built in a way that reasonably protects against malicious cyber actors successfully gaining access to devices, data, and connected infrastructure”. In simple words, Secure-by-Design is a concept that prioritizes security from the very beginning of the design process. Instead of developing security features after a product is launched either due to breaches or internally found vulnerabilities, SbD embeds these features into the core architecture of the device or system in a proactive fashion. Think of it like building a castle with walls, gates, and all defenses planned from the blueprint stage, rather than adding these elements after the structure is already built. According to a report published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), this approach is essential because it will help reducing vulnerabilities by addressing them during the design phase and in all steps of the development lifecycle. By integrating security practices in early stages, developers can avoid risks such as memory safety issues, which have historically posed big issues to software systems.</p> <h2 id="why-secure-by-design-is-important-for-iot" style="--stagger: 7;" data-animate="">Why Secure-by-Design is important for IoT?</h2> <p style="--stagger: 8;" data-animate="">IoT devices are more vulnerable to cyberattacks because of their interconnected nature and often with limited security measures either due to their hardware limited resources or related cost. As these devices emerge and get into critical applications, securing them becomes an important task. The risks are not just theoretical; they are real and growing and every day we witness new exploits using vulnerabilities in these devices. Consider the infamous Mirai botnet attack, which exploited vulnerable IoT devices to launch a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, shutting down websites and services globally. Another significant incident occurred in 2022 when the Russian threat actor group known as “APT44/Sandworm” targeted critical infrastructure in Ukraine. According to one of Google’s Threat Intelligence report, the attackers gained unauthorized access to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, subsequently manipulating the victim’s substation circuit breakers. This malicious action resulted in disabling the power grids across major regions of Ukraine.</p> <p style="--stagger: 9;" data-animate="">Incorporating secure-by-design principles in IoT development can address possible vulnerabilities in advance. For instance, using memory-safe programming languages is one way to prevent common attacks like buffer overflows. These languages, such as Rust, are designed to avoid many of the pitfalls that lead to vulnerabilities in traditional languages like C and C++. Moreover, SbD could be extended beyond software. It also includes hardware-based security features, such as secure boot processes, which ensure that only trusted software can run on a device. This is particularly important in IoT, where devices are often deployed in diverse and sometimes hostile environments.</p> <h2 id="best-practices-for-secure-by-design-in-iot" style="--stagger: 10;" data-animate="">Best Practices for Secure-by-Design in IoT</h2> <p style="--stagger: 11;" data-animate="">In April 2023, the CISA, along with the NSA, FBI, and international partners from countries including Australia, Canada, the UK, and Japan, issued a complete guidelines on secure-by-design principles. This guidance, updated in October 2023, calls for technology providers to take greater ownership of their products’ security, shifting the responsibility away from consumers and small organizations. Their report, “Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security-by-Design and Default,” outlines three core principles:</p> <p style="--stagger: 12;" data-animate="">Take ownership of customer security outcomes: Technology manufacturers must prioritize the security of their products through the entire lifecycle, from conception to deployment . Embrace radical transparency and accountability: Companies should openly share information about their security practices, vulnerabilities, and improvements. This includes publishing detailed statistics and trends about product security. Lead from the top: Security must be elevated to a core business priority, led by executive-level commitment and integrated into the organizational culture and vision. To put these principles into practice, an organization may require a multi-faceted approach that included the following actions:</p> <p style="--stagger: 13;" data-animate="">Implementing security-centric culture by establishing regular meetings with executive leadership to drive the importance of secure-by-design. Create policies that reward teams for developing secure products. Implementing threat modeling during the development process of a system or software to identify and correct potential vulnerabilities proactively. Adopting secure coding practices by prioritizing the use of memory-safe programming languages like Rust. Google, for instance, has reported that up to 70% of their security vulnerabilities were due to memory safety issues. Incorporating hardware-based security by using secure boot processes and hardware security modules (HSMs) to ensure device integrity. Implementing continuous automated security testing throughout the development process, including static and dynamic analysis tools. Enhancing secure-by-default configurations with features like multi-factor authentication enabled by default and at no additional cost. Implementing continuous monitoring and updates. Companies like Fortinet are leading the way in implementing these principles. Their approach includes rigorous internal code testing and analysis, active threat hunting, proactive communication about vulnerabilities, and incorporation of industry-recognized best practices. For instance, Fortinet’s Secure Product Development Lifecycle Policy (SPDLC) ensures that security is built into each product from inception, covering every stage of the product life cycle. Other industry leaders are already embracing SbD principles:</p> <p style="--stagger: 14;" data-animate="">Google’s Android: By transitioning to memory-safe languages, Google has effectively eliminated entire classes of vulnerabilities in Android. Bosch’s CISS: The Connected Industrial Sensor Solution incorporates a secure element chip for cryptographic operations, protecting against both physical and cyber attacks. Medical IoT: Companies like Medtronic are implementing built-in secure communication protocols in implantable devices, safeguarding against potentially life-threatening hacks.</p> <h2 id="challenges-and-considerations" style="--stagger: 15;" data-animate="">Challenges and Considerations</h2> <p style="--stagger: 16;" data-animate="">Of course, implementing secure-by-design doesn’t come without challenges. It requires to change the mindset and put more commitment from manufacturers to make security as one of the main priorities from the beginning. Additionally, there are many technical challenges, such as ensuring that secure design practices are scalable and applicable to the wide type and requirements of IoT devices on the market. Another significant challenge is the need for standardization. Without clear and universally adopted standards, it can be difficult to ensure that all IoT devices meet a minimum security baseline. More challenges are still valid and need to be addressed, such as:</p> <p style="--stagger: 17;" data-animate="">Balancing security and usability: Stringent security measures may impact user experience, requiring a delicate balance. Resource constraints: Smaller manufacturers may struggle with the initial investment required for comprehensive security measures. Legacy systems: adding modern security features to existing and old IoT devices can be technically challenging and sometimes economically unfeasible. Evolving threats: The rapidly changing nature of cyber-threats requires constant vigilance and adaptation as attackers develop new techniques and add more challenges. The last consideration I would like to mention, other than the technical ones, is the economic implications of this concept. While it requires initial investment and may extend development timelines, the long-term benefits are substantial.</p> <h2 id="looking-forward" style="--stagger: 18;" data-animate="">Looking Forward:</h2> <p style="--stagger: 19;" data-animate="">Looking ahead, the integration of AI and ML into SbD practices promises to further enhance IoT security. These tools could enable more advances threat modeling and automated security testing, helping to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities more effectively and proactively.</p> <p style="--stagger: 20;" data-animate="">So, is secure-by-design the key to IoT cybersecurity? I believe it’s a critical piece of the solution. By integrating security from the very beginning, we can build IoT systems with already good foundations from a security perspective.</p> <p style="--stagger: 21;" data-animate="">In conclusion, secure-by-design is not just a best practice or some principles that should be followed; it’s becoming an essential strategy for surviving and improving in an increasingly connected and vulnerable digital landscape. As technology providers take more responsibility for the security of their products from the early development stages, we can say that we move closer to a future where IoT devices enhance our lives without compromising public safety and privacy.</p> </div> </article> <div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=determineComputedTheme(),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"NordineQuadar/nordinequadar.github.io","data-repo-id":"R_kgDOL959Kg","data-category":"General","data-category-id":"DIC_kwDOL959Ks4CfrW6","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"0","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"bottom","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,e])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,e)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Nordine Quadar, P.Eng.
