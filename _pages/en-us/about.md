<p>
    Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my spot on the web!
</p>
<p>
    I'm like a mix of an engineer and a researcher, always curious and trying new things. I started my academic journey at the <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/">University of Ottawa</a>, where I studied electrical engineering and computer science for my bachelor's and master's degrees.
</p>
<p>
    For over a decade now, I've gained rich experiences across diverse industries and global landscapes. From my early days in field service roles to assuming technical leadership positions, I've navigated the complex challenges of life and real-world engineering with resilience and adaptability.
</p>
<p>
    But here's the cool part: I've always had this itch for learning. After finishing up my master's degree under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.eecs.uottawa.ca/~damours/\">Claude D'Amours</a>, I thought, why not keep the momentum going? So, I dove into the Ph.D. adventure in Wireless security at the <a href="https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en">Royal Military College of Canada</a> as civilian, with Prof. <a href="https://www.chehri.com/\">Abdellah Chehri</a> as my director of research. I was doing this while I am having a full time job, a family and the birth of two beautiful kids :D. The Ph.D. project was not a plan for making money or looking for new positions, don't get me wrong! I would love to have better finance or a new career and I am working on that, but it was for the sake of learning. But the nice thing is that we got public funding for the project from <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/\">MITACS</a> and with the collaboration with <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/\">Thales Digital Identity and Security</a>. I also work in collaboration with researchers from different countries and write papers about the effect of AI and its use, new technologies or techniques such as smart cities, digital twin, renewable energies, and cybersecurity. I have tried many startup ideas and work on new ones.
</p>
<p>
    Here's where I am! Keep learning and enjoying the journey...
