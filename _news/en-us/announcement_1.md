I recently had the privilege of delivering my first keynote talk at BDIoT conference held in Fez-Morocco (the home of the oldest university in the world - University of al-Qarawiyyin). I shared my insights on the critical issue of cybersecurity in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) era. As I got more into this topic, it became clear to me that the battle between AI-powered cybersecurity and AI-enhanced cyberattacks is one of the most significant challenges we face today. 

This game is just starting, but I'm hopeful that by using AI responsibly and understanding its implications, we can build a more secure future for the industrial sector and beyond.
