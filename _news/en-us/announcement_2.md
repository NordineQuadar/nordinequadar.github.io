I had the privilege of presenting one of our latest research on "Audio Recognition-based Method for RF Transmitters Classification using CNN-LSTM model" at the IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computing Engineering held at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Our work explores how audio recognition techniques can enhance RF device identification and authentication.

Beyond presenting our research, I also participated in David Newman, PhD fascinating workshop on team creativity and design thinking using LEGO® Serious Play® methods. What started as an unconventional approach quickly proved to be incredibly effective for exploring team dynamics and fostering innovation. The hands-on activities provided fresh perspectives on collaborative problem-solving that I'm excited to apply in both academic and professional settings.

The conference showcased the diverse applications of engineering research - from cybersecurity and machine learning to creative methodologies that enhance team performance. It's conferences like these that remind me why I love being part of the engineering community.

Thank you to all the organizers, fellow researchers, and workshop facilitators who made this such a valuable experience. Looking forward to implementing these new insights in future projects!
