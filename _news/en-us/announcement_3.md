I'm thrilled to share that I delivered a seminar last week on "Advanced Deep Learning-Driven Radio Frequency Fingerprinting for Securing IoT and UAV Systems in Dynamic Wireless Environments" for the defense scientists team at Defence Research and Development Canada, Ottawa. The presentation sparked meaningful discussions, and I'm honored to receive a Certificate of Appreciation for my contribution! A big thank you to Defence Research and Development Canada Ottawa Research Centre (DRDC Ottawa) for the opportunity and positive feedback.

This work, part of my PhD research, focuses on robust authentication in contested environments, a growing defense priority. I'm grateful for the support from my director of research, Prof. Abdellah Chehri at the Royal Military College of Canada/Coll√®ge militaire royal du Canada, who made this possible.
